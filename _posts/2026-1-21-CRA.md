I'm honored to receive an honorable mention for the Computing Research Association's Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award!

The CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award recognizes undergraduate students in North American colleges and universities who show outstanding research potential in computing. The award considers students' research accomplishments, the impact of their contributions to their research area, and their potential for continued success in computing research.

I'm grateful to my department for nominating me, as well as the support from my research mentors and collaborators who made this recognition possible.
