I recently had the opportunity to co-present our paper "PaleoScan: Low-Cost Easy-to-use High-Volume Fossil Scanning" at ACM CHI 2024 in Honolulu, Hawaii, alongside João Rulff!

It was so exciting to be able to share PaleoScan with researchers from around the world and engage in conversations about accessible technology for scientific research.

You can read the full paper in the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642020) and watch our [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBupqi6NLog). More details are also available on my [publications page](/publications/).
