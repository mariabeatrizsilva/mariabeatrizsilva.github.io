I'm excited to share that I've been selected as one of the 63 finalists for the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) Aspirations in Computing Award for my work on GeneVA ([project description here](/publications/))!

The NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing honors young women and gender-expansive students for their computing-related achievements and interests. The award recognizes technical contributions to prokects with a high potential for impact. 

Thank you to all of my collaborators on the project!
