## Research Interests

I develop computational methods at the intersection of computer graphics, human perception, and machine learning. My work at NYU's Immersive Computer Lab explores how perceptual principles can inform graphics optimization, particularly in mesh processing and rendering for virtual environments. I'm seeking PhD opportunities to advance research in perceptually-driven computational graphics.
