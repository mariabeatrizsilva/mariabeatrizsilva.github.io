    My research focuses on developing computational methods for computer graphics, particularly at the intersection of rendering systems and machine learning. I'm interested in how perceptual principles can guide graphics algorithm design—questions like: How can we optimize rendering techniques to align with human visual perception? How do we evaluate the quality of AI-generated visual content? 
    
    At NYU's Immersive Computing Lab, I work on projects spanning perceptually-guided approaches temporal antialiasing and human-in-the-loop quality assessment for text-to-video generation models (see more in my publications and projects tab!). 
    
    I've spent the past two summers interning at Duolingo—first as a Software Engineering Thrive Intern, then on the Design Accelerator team developing internal tools for animators and designers

<!-- In pursuit of this, she worked on the PaleoScan, a low-cost fossil-scanning system designed to democratize access to scientific discovery (published at ACM CHI), and her current work is focusing on perceptually-guided approaches to improve rendering techniques.    -->


I am also a proponent for expanding access to STEM education. I worked as a teaching assistant at [ELiTE Education](https://www.elite-education.org), an organization that teaches CS to NYC high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds, and continue to mentor students as they enter college.
