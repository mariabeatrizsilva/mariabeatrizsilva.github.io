Maria Beatriz is a Presidential Honors Scholar studying Computer Science at NYU Courant with a minor in Mathematics. As a Research Assistant at NYU’s Immersive Computing Lab, she develops computational methods at the intersection of computer graphics, human perception, and machine learning. 
Her work is driven by the commitment to ensure technology is developed with the needs of its users in mind and by the desire to reshape who gets to participate in and benefit from technical innovation.   

In pursuit of this, she worked on the PaleoScan, a low-cost fossil-scanning system designed to democratize access to scientific discovery (published at ACM CHI), and her current work is focusing on perceptually-guided approaches to improve rendering techniques.   

She has spent the past two summers interning at Duolingo—first as a Software Engineering Thrive Intern, then on the Design Accelerator team developing internal tools for animators and designers.  

Finally, Maria Beatriz is a proponent for expanding access to STEM education. She worked as a teaching assistant at ELiTE Education (an organization that teaches CS to NYC high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds) and continues to mentor some of her previous students as they enter college.
