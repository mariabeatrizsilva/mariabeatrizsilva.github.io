I'm a Presidential Honors Scholar and Senior at NYU's Courant Institute studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. As a Research Assistant at NYU's Immersive Computing Lab, I develop computational methods at the intersection of computer graphics, human perception, and machine learning, working under the guidance of Prof. Qi Sun.

## Research Interests

My research explores how perceptual principles can inform the design of graphics systems and human-computer interaction. I'm fascinated by questions at the interface of perception and computation: How can we build rendering systems that align with human visual perception? How do we evaluate the quality of AI-generated visual content through a perceptual lens? What makes graphics algorithms perceptually effective?

I'm particularly interested in perceptually-driven optimization techniques for real-time graphics, quality assessment for generative models, and developing systems that directly serve their end users by direclty considering users' needs and how they interact with technology (from both perceptual and HCI standpoints).

## Current Research

At NYU's Immersive Computing Lab, I'm currently contributing to two research projects:

**Perceptually-Guided Temporal Antialiasing**: For my honors thesis, I'm investigating how temporal antialiasing (TAA) parameters relate to perceptual quality metrics. This work aims to develop perceptually-informed optimization strategies that improve visual quality in real-time rendering systems.

**GeneVA Dataset Project**: Diffusion models now support realistic text-to-video generation, but state-of-the-art models produce unique spatio-temporal artifacts absent in static images. To address the lack of human-annotated feedback datasets for video evaluation, we created GeneVA. My contributions included implementing the end-to-end data pipeline, conducting literature reviews, influencing our artifact taxonomy, and contributing to paper writing.

## Beyond Research

I'm committed to expanding access to computer science education. As an Education Fellow for Emerging Leaders in Technology and Engineering (ELiTE), I taught C++ and Arduino programming to high school students from underrepresented backgrounds. I continue to mentor several former students as they transition into college, recently advising a student conducting summer research at MIT on computer graphics.

My goal is to become a researcher who doesn't just push the technical state-of-the-art, but fundamentally reshapes who gets to participate in and benefit from technological innovation. I want to create graphics systems that are designed with deep consideration for human perception and the diverse needs of actual users.
